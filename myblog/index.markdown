We have created a keyboard application to allow anyone, with a Tobii 5 Eye Tracker, to type only using their eyes. Using an electron application, we have been able to create the environment which allows anyone to type only using our eyes. Here, we will give some demonstrations of the Eye Tracking Keyboard Application while it is in use. We will also be providing links to go and download this yourself.
